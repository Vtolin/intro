# Personal Website

Welcome to the source code of my personal portfolio website!  
This site is built with **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. No frameworks, no libraries, just clean, handwritten code. It's fully responsive, optimized for performance, and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

**Live Demo:** [intpas.vercel.app](https://intpas.vercel.app)

## Overview

This personal website showcases:
- My **projects** (including full-stack apps)
- My **technical skills** in frontend/backend
- A separate **photography section**
- A dark mode toggle
- A working **contact form** via Formspree

It’s meant to be both a creative outlet and a developer portfolio.
