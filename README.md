# 🌐 Rajendra Pasha — Personal Website

Welcome to the source code of my personal portfolio website!  
This site is built with **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no frameworks, no libraries — just clean, handwritten code. It's fully responsive, optimized for performance, and hosted with ❤️ on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## 📖 Overview

This personal website showcases:
- My **projects** (including full-stack apps)
