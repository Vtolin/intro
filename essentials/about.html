          I'm Rajendra Pasha, also known as Pasha. I am a student at SMA Triguna
          Utama. I started learning to code in March 2024 on
          <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a
          >. The first programming language I learned was JavaScript (after
          learning HTML and CSS). Currently, I am learning to become a
          full-stack developer and plan to explore Machine Learning and Software
          Engineering in the future.

          I started learning coding in March 2024 on
          <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>
          after watching a short video about someone who became a software
          engineer starting on that platform. I've been interested in coding
          since 2022, but I didn't fully commit to learning it until March 2024.
          I began with the basics like HTML and CSS, and then moved on to
          JavaScript, as it's often recommended as a beginner-friendly
          programming language. Originally, my goal was to become a software
          engineer, but after diving into web development, I decided to focus on
          becoming a full-stack developer first. Once I gain enough experience,
          I plan to take my next steps into the software engineering market.
